## About
<b>Charms Bar Port</b> will help you bring back the Windows 8.x Charms Bar to Windows 10 and Windows 11, using real files from Windows 8.x to enhance your Windows environment and relive the Windows 8.x days. As the name suggests, it's a 1:1 conversion of the infamous Charms Bar with new features and hotfixes from the original.

Forked and completely edited from <a href="https://github.com/Jerhynh/CharmsBarRevived">CharmsBarRevived</a>, <b>Charms Bar Port</b> will assist on helping any Charms Bar fan make the jump from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 or Windows 11, without having to stay on the obsolete operating system forever...

## Why was this created?
In December 17, 2014 and October 5, 2021, Microsoft made the annoucement to completely remove the Charms Bar in Windows 10 and 11. There used to be ways to restore it in the old years (2015-2021) using ValiiNet Charms, PopCharms, and RocketDock.


But now, ValiNet Charms is no longer available to download since 2025 and 2026, PopCharms was only meant to be used between Windows 10 build 9780 and Windows 10 build 9913 (those versions are currently outdated), and RocketDock is <b>very</b> outdated, so this project was created primarily to bring for needs of a Charms Bar back.

## How does it work?
On touch screens, swipe from the right edge towards to bring up the Charms Bar. If you're a mouse user, swipe to the top right corner and drag your cursor down to open the Charms Bar. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Windows key + C, just like it was on Windows 8 and 8.1. Included in the Charms Bar are:
<br />
<br />
<b>Search:</b> Opens the search bar from the taskbar on Win32 programs (easily remappable to function as <a href="https://github.com/srwi/EverythingToolbar">EverythingToolbar</a>, perhaps maybe even more programs that support hotkeys), or on supported Metro apps, brings their Search charm.<br />
<b>Share:</b> Opens the share charm.<br />
<b>Start:</b> Opens the start menu/screen. If you are using <a href="https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu">Open-Shell</a>, you can remap this button to open up their start menu instead or to completely disable its functionality.<br />
<b>Devices:</b> Opens the Connect charm. On supported Metro apps, they will open the print dialog.<br />
<b>Settings:</b> Opens the Settings Metro app on Win32 programs or the Settings charm on supported Metro apps.
